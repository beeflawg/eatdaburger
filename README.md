# eatdaburger

## I have the devour button working correctly,  however I keep getting errors when trying add and remove burgers from the lists.
### 1: Error 404, when trying to link the ajax js into the main.handlebars, says it can't locate the file
### 2: Error 500, when I hardcode it into main.handlebars,
#### TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined at /Users/befort/Desktop/uofa/Homework/eatdaburger/controllers/burger_controller.js:23:14
